"@emdash-cms/cloudflare": minor

Adds a `hyperdrive()` database adapter for connecting EmDash on Cloudflare Workers to a PostgreSQL (or PostgreSQL-compatible, e.g. PlanetScale Postgres) database through a Hyperdrive binding. Configure it with `database: hyperdrive({ binding: "HYPERDRIVE" })`. Each request gets its own pooled connection that is opened and closed within that request — connections cannot be reused across Worker requests. Requires `pg >= 8.16.3`, the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag, and a compatibility date of `2024-09-23` or later. Disable Hyperdrive query caching for the configuration so the admin's read-after-write stays consistent.

The content read/write path, scheduled publishing, plugin cron, and database-querying plugin hooks are all supported. Sandboxed plugins remain D1-only (the sandbox bridge talks to a D1 binding directly, independent of the configured adapter).
